# GuessTheNumber
Welcome to my Number Guessing Game built with C! This interactive program generates a random number between 1 and 100, inviting players to guess it while receiving helpful hints along the way. Designed to be simple yet engaging, this project uses C's control structures, loops, and random number generation to create an enjoyable guessing experience.
